# Create IAM user with console access + mfa

This happens in two separate steps.

1. First step is to create the IAM user. During this step you need to use an existing (admin) user if any or the root user (to create the admin user). It is important to select 'AWS Management console access' during setup. Then provide the real life user with the username and password. You can find further details below.

2. The newly created user needs to sign in, and set up multi-factor authentication. You can find further details in the attached separate document.
