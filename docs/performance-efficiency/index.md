  <h1>Performance Efficiency Pillar</h1>
  <p>The performance efficiency pillar focuses on using IT and computing resources efficiently. Key topics include selecting the right resource types and sizes based on workload requirements, monitoring performance, and making informed decisions to maintain efficiency as business needs evolve.</p>
</div>

The Performance Efficiency pillar includes the ability to support development and run workloads effectively, gain insight into their operations, and to continuously improve supporting processes and procedures to deliver business value.

## Key Areas

The Performance Efficiency pillar includes the following key areas:

- **Selection** - Choosing the right compute, storage, database, and networking solutions
- **Review** - Continuously evaluating new services and technologies
- **Monitoring** - Ensuring resources are performing as expected
- **Tradeoffs** - Using caching, partitioning, and other techniques to improve performance

## Questions

The AWS Well-Architected Framework provides a set of questions that allows you to review an existing or proposed architecture. It also provides a set of AWS best practices for each pillar.
