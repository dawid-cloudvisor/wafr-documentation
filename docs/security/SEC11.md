  <h1>SEC11: How do you incorporate and validate the security properties of applications throughout the design, development, and deployment lifecycle?</h1>
  <p>Training people, testing your security properties, and validating that you are meeting your security requirements are key elements to consider when developing any application. Adopting application security testing as a regular part of your software development lifecycle (SDLC) and post-deployment processes help validate that you're implementing security controls properly. Your application security testing should also be performed regularly as part of your security assessment processes.</p>

## Key Concepts

### Application Security Fundamentals

**Security by Design**: Integrate security considerations from the earliest stages of application design and architecture. Security should be a fundamental requirement, not an afterthought added during or after development.

**Shift-Left Security**: Move security testing and validation activities earlier in the development lifecycle. Early detection and remediation of security issues is more cost-effective and reduces risk.

**DevSecOps Integration**: Seamlessly integrate security practices, tools, and responsibilities into DevOps workflows. Security becomes everyone's responsibility, not just the security team's.

**Continuous Security Validation**: Implement ongoing security testing and validation throughout the application lifecycle, from development through production deployment and maintenance.

### Application Security Lifecycle

**Design Phase**: Incorporate threat modeling, security requirements definition, and secure architecture design. Establish security controls and design patterns that will be implemented throughout development.

**Development Phase**: Implement secure coding practices, conduct code reviews, and perform static application security testing (SAST). Ensure developers have the training and tools needed for secure development.

**Testing Phase**: Execute comprehensive security testing including dynamic application security testing (DAST), interactive application security testing (IAST), and dependency scanning.

**Deployment Phase**: Validate security configurations, perform final security assessments, and ensure secure deployment practices. Implement runtime application self-protection (RASP) where appropriate.

**Operations Phase**: Maintain ongoing security monitoring, conduct regular security assessments, and respond to newly discovered vulnerabilities in production applications.
