  <h1>SEC08: How do you protect your data at rest?</h1>
  <p>Protecting your data at rest reduces the risk of unauthorized access, when encryption keys are securely managed. Encryption should be applied based on the classification of your data. You should encrypt everything by default, and consider additional protections such as access controls and backups. Access to your data should be audited using detective controls, and you should inventory what data you have and where it's stored.</p>

## Overview

Protecting data at rest is a critical security requirement that involves multiple layers of defense working together to ensure comprehensive data protection. This question focuses on four key areas that build upon each other to create a robust data protection framework:

1. **Secure Key Management (SEC08-BP01)**: Establish the foundation with proper encryption key lifecycle management, rotation, and access control
2. **Encryption Enforcement (SEC08-BP02)**: Implement comprehensive encryption across all data storage services with automated compliance monitoring
3. **Protection Automation (SEC08-BP03)**: Deploy automated systems for continuous protection, monitoring, and remediation
4. **Access Control (SEC08-BP04)**: Enforce fine-grained access controls that work in conjunction with encryption to provide defense-in-depth

This comprehensive approach ensures that data is protected not just through encryption, but through a complete security framework that includes proper key management, automated enforcement, continuous monitoring, and robust access controls.

## Key Concepts

### Data at Rest Protection Fundamentals

**Encryption by Default**: Apply encryption to all data stored in your systems, regardless of sensitivity level. This provides a baseline level of protection and simplifies security management by eliminating the need to determine which data requires encryption.

**Defense in Depth**: Implement multiple layers of protection for data at rest, including encryption, access controls, network security, and physical security measures. No single control should be relied upon to protect sensitive data.

**Key Management**: Securely generate, store, rotate, and manage encryption keys throughout their lifecycle. Proper key management is critical to maintaining the effectiveness of encryption and ensuring data can be accessed when needed.

**Access Control Integration**: Combine encryption with robust access controls to ensure that even if encryption is compromised, unauthorized users cannot access sensitive data without proper authentication and authorization.

### Data Protection Layers

**Storage-Level Encryption**: Encrypt data at the storage layer using services like Amazon EBS encryption, Amazon S3 server-side encryption, and Amazon RDS encryption. This provides transparent encryption with minimal performance impact.

**Application-Level Encryption**: Implement encryption within applications before data is stored, providing additional control over encryption keys and algorithms. This is particularly important for highly sensitive data.

**Database Encryption**: Use database-native encryption features such as Transparent Data Encryption (TDE) for structured data, combined with encrypted backups and transaction logs.

**Backup and Archive Encryption**: Ensure that all backup copies and archived data are encrypted using the same or stronger encryption standards as the primary data.
