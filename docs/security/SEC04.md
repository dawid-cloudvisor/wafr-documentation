  <h1>SEC04: How do you detect and investigate security events?</h1>
  <p>Capture and analyze events from logs and metrics to gain visibility. Take action on security events and potential threats to help secure your workload. These events include changes to your AWS resources, administrative actions, network traffic, and application behavior. Security operations teams require access to logs and the ability to search and investigate events across workloads and time. When a potential issue is identified, you need to have a process to investigate and respond appropriately.</p>

## Key Concepts

### Security Event Detection Fundamentals

**Comprehensive Logging**: Capture security-relevant events from all layers of your workload, including infrastructure, applications, and user activities. Logs provide the foundation for security monitoring and incident investigation.

**Centralized Analysis**: Aggregate logs and security findings in standardized locations to enable efficient analysis, correlation, and response. Centralization improves visibility and reduces the time to detect and respond to threats.

**Event Correlation**: Combine related security events to identify patterns, reduce noise, and provide context for security analysts. Correlation helps distinguish between isolated events and coordinated attacks.

**Automated Response**: Implement automated remediation for known security violations and misconfigurations to reduce response time and ensure consistent application of security policies.

### Security Operations Components

**Detection**: Identify potential security threats through log analysis, anomaly detection, and threat intelligence integration.

**Investigation**: Analyze security events to determine their nature, scope, and potential impact on your workload.

**Response**: Take appropriate action to contain, mitigate, and remediate security incidents.

**Recovery**: Restore normal operations and implement improvements to prevent similar incidents.
