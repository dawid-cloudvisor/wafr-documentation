<h1>REL09: How do you back up data?</h1>
<p>Back up data, applications, and configuration to meet requirements for recovery time objectives (RTO) and recovery point objectives (RPO). Data backup is a critical component of any disaster recovery strategy and business continuity plan, ensuring that your data is protected against various failure scenarios and can be recovered when needed.</p>
</div>

## Overview

Data backup is fundamental to maintaining business continuity and protecting against data loss from various failure scenarios including hardware failures, human errors, security incidents, and natural disasters. Effective backup strategies must be comprehensive, automated, and regularly tested to ensure data can be recovered within defined recovery objectives. This involves implementing multi-layered backup approaches, automated scheduling, secure storage, and regular validation to ensure backup integrity and recoverability.

## Key Concepts

### Backup Strategy Principles

**Comprehensive Coverage**: Identify and protect all critical data assets including databases, file systems, configurations, and application state to ensure complete system recovery capability.

**Recovery Objectives**: Define clear Recovery Time Objectives (RTO) and Recovery Point Objectives (RPO) that align with business requirements and drive backup frequency and retention decisions.

**Multi-Layered Protection**: Implement multiple backup layers including local, regional, and cross-region backups to protect against different failure scenarios and ensure data durability.

**Automated Operations**: Implement fully automated backup processes that eliminate manual intervention, reduce human error, and ensure consistent backup execution.

### Foundational Backup Elements

**Data Classification**: Categorize data by criticality, sensitivity, and recovery requirements to implement appropriate backup strategies and retention policies for different data types.

**Backup Validation**: Regularly test backup integrity and recovery procedures to ensure backups are viable and recovery processes work as expected when needed.

**Security Integration**: Implement comprehensive security measures including encryption, access controls, and audit logging to protect backup data from unauthorized access and tampering.

**Cost Optimization**: Use appropriate storage classes, lifecycle policies, and retention strategies to balance data protection requirements with storage costs and operational efficiency.
