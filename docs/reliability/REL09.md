# REL09: How do you back up data?

Data backup is a critical component of any disaster recovery strategy and business continuity plan. Effective backup strategies ensure that your data is protected against various failure scenarios, including hardware failures, human errors, security incidents, and natural disasters. Modern backup solutions must be automated, tested regularly, and designed to meet specific recovery time and recovery point objectives.

Comprehensive data backup requires multiple layers of protection, including automated backup scheduling, cross-region replication, backup validation, and regular recovery testing. By implementing these practices, organizations can ensure data durability and maintain business operations even in the face of significant disruptions.

## Best Practices

- [REL09-BP01: Identify and back up all data that needs to be backed up, or reproduce the data from sources](./REL09-BP01.html)
- [REL09-BP02: Secure and encrypt backups](./REL09-BP02.html)
- [REL09-BP03: Perform data backup automatically](./REL09-BP03.html)
- [REL09-BP04: Perform periodic recovery of the data to verify backup integrity and processes](./REL09-BP04.html)

## Implementation Approach

### 1. Data Classification and Backup Strategy
- Identify critical data assets and classify by importance and sensitivity
- Define Recovery Time Objectives (RTO) and Recovery Point Objectives (RPO)
- Establish backup retention policies and lifecycle management
- Design backup strategies based on data criticality and compliance requirements

### 2. Backup Architecture Design
- Implement multi-tier backup strategies (local, regional, cross-region)
- Design automated backup scheduling and orchestration
- Establish backup storage optimization and cost management
- Configure backup monitoring and alerting systems

### 3. Security and Compliance
- Implement encryption for data in transit and at rest
- Establish access controls and audit logging for backup operations
- Design compliance-aware backup retention and deletion policies
- Configure backup validation and integrity checking

### 4. Recovery Planning and Testing
- Develop comprehensive disaster recovery procedures
- Implement automated recovery testing and validation
- Establish recovery time monitoring and optimization
- Design business continuity and communication plans

### 5. Monitoring and Optimization
- Track backup success rates and performance metrics
- Monitor storage utilization and cost optimization
- Implement continuous improvement based on recovery testing
- Establish backup governance and policy enforcement

### 6. Automation and Orchestration
- Automate backup scheduling and lifecycle management
- Implement cross-service backup coordination
- Design backup workflow orchestration and dependencies
- Establish automated compliance and audit reporting

## Key Considerations

- **Data Classification**: Understand what data needs to be backed up and its criticality
- **Recovery Objectives**: Define clear RTO and RPO requirements for different data types
- **Backup Frequency**: Balance backup frequency with storage costs and performance impact
- **Geographic Distribution**: Implement cross-region backups for disaster recovery
- **Encryption**: Ensure all backups are encrypted both in transit and at rest
- **Testing**: Regularly test backup and recovery procedures to ensure they work
- **Compliance**: Meet regulatory requirements for data retention and protection
- **Cost Optimization**: Use appropriate storage classes and lifecycle policies
