<h1>REL02: How do you plan your network topology?</h1>
<p>Workloads often exist in multiple environments. These include multiple cloud environments (both publicly accessible and private) and possibly your existing data center infrastructure. Plans must include network considerations such as intra- and inter-system connectivity, public IP address management, private IP address management, and domain name resolution.</p>
</div>

## Overview

Network topology planning is fundamental to building reliable, scalable, and secure applications on AWS. A well-designed network topology provides the foundation for high availability, fault tolerance, and optimal performance while enabling secure communication between components. This involves careful consideration of connectivity patterns, IP address allocation, DNS resolution, and traffic routing across multiple availability zones and regions.

## Key Concepts

### Network Topology Principles

**High Availability Design**: Design network topologies that eliminate single points of failure and provide redundant connectivity paths across multiple availability zones and regions.

**Scalable Architecture**: Plan for growth by allocating sufficient IP address space, designing for horizontal scaling, and implementing network patterns that can accommodate increasing traffic loads.

**Security by Design**: Implement network segmentation, traffic isolation, and secure connectivity patterns that protect against unauthorized access and data breaches.

**Performance Optimization**: Design network topologies that minimize latency, maximize throughput, and provide optimal user experience through strategic placement of resources.

### Foundational Network Elements

**Connectivity Planning**: Establish reliable, redundant connectivity between cloud environments, on-premises infrastructure, and external services with appropriate bandwidth and failover capabilities.

**IP Address Management**: Plan IP address allocation to avoid conflicts, enable expansion, and support multi-region deployments with proper subnet sizing and CIDR block management.

**DNS Strategy**: Implement robust domain name resolution that supports high availability, geographic routing, and seamless failover between regions and availability zones.

**Traffic Routing**: Design intelligent traffic routing that can adapt to failures, distribute load effectively, and provide optimal performance across different network paths.
