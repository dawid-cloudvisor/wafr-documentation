<h1>REL06: How do you monitor workload resources?</h1>
<p>Logs and metrics are powerful tools to gain insight into the health of your workload. You can configure your workload to monitor logs and metrics and send notifications when thresholds are crossed or significant events occur. Monitoring enables your workload to recognize when low-performance thresholds are crossed or failures occur, so it can recover automatically.</p>
</div>

## Overview

Comprehensive monitoring is the foundation of reliable systems, providing visibility into workload health, performance, and behavior. Effective monitoring enables proactive issue detection, automated response to problems, and data-driven optimization decisions. This involves implementing monitoring across all layers of your architecture, from infrastructure metrics to business KPIs, with appropriate alerting and automated responses to maintain system reliability.

## Key Concepts

### Monitoring Fundamentals

**Observability**: Implement comprehensive observability through metrics, logs, and traces to understand system behavior and quickly identify issues. This includes both technical metrics and business metrics that matter to your organization.

**Proactive Monitoring**: Design monitoring systems that detect issues before they impact users, enabling preventive action rather than reactive responses to outages and performance problems.

**Automated Response**: Implement automated responses to common issues and threshold breaches, reducing mean time to recovery and minimizing human intervention for routine problems.

**Layered Monitoring**: Monitor at multiple layers including infrastructure, application, and business levels to provide comprehensive visibility into system health and performance.

### Foundational Monitoring Elements

**Metrics Collection**: Gather quantitative data about system performance, resource utilization, and business outcomes to enable data-driven decisions and automated responses.

**Log Aggregation**: Centralize log collection and analysis to enable troubleshooting, audit trails, and pattern recognition across distributed systems.

**Real-time Processing**: Implement real-time monitoring and alerting to enable rapid response to issues and prevent small problems from becoming major outages.

**Dashboard Visualization**: Create comprehensive dashboards that provide at-a-glance visibility into system health for both technical teams and business stakeholders.
