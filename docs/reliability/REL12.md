<h1>REL12: How do you test reliability?</h1>
<p>Testing reliability is essential to ensure your workload can withstand real-world conditions and recover from failures. Implement systematic testing of functional requirements, performance under load, resilience to failures, and continuous improvement through post-incident analysis and chaos engineering practices.</p>
</div>

## Overview

Reliability testing is fundamental to building confidence in your system's ability to handle real-world conditions, failures, and unexpected scenarios. Effective reliability testing goes beyond functional testing to include performance validation, resilience testing, and continuous learning from both planned experiments and actual incidents. This comprehensive approach ensures that your workload can maintain availability and performance under various conditions while providing mechanisms for continuous improvement.

## Key Concepts

### Reliability Testing Principles

**Comprehensive Validation**: Test all aspects of system reliability including functional correctness, performance under load, resilience to failures, and recovery capabilities.

**Continuous Testing**: Implement ongoing testing practices that validate reliability throughout the development lifecycle and in production environments.

**Failure Investigation**: Use systematic approaches to investigate failures, learn from incidents, and improve system resilience based on real-world experiences.

**Chaos Engineering**: Proactively inject failures and test system behavior under adverse conditions to identify weaknesses before they impact users.

### Foundational Testing Elements

**Playbook-Driven Investigation**: Use structured playbooks and procedures to investigate failures systematically and ensure consistent response to incidents.

**Post-Incident Analysis**: Conduct thorough analysis of incidents to identify root causes, contributing factors, and opportunities for improvement.

**Performance Testing**: Validate system behavior under various load conditions to ensure it can handle expected and peak traffic scenarios.

**Resilience Testing**: Test system behavior during failures, network partitions, and other adverse conditions to validate recovery mechanisms.
