# REL12: How do you test reliability?

Testing reliability is essential to ensure your workload can withstand real-world conditions and recover from failures. This involves systematic testing of functional requirements, performance under load, resilience to failures, and continuous improvement through post-incident analysis and chaos engineering practices.

## Implementation Approach

Comprehensive reliability testing requires a multi-faceted approach that validates your system's behavior under normal and adverse conditions. The strategy focuses on:

1. **Systematic Investigation**: Using playbooks to investigate and resolve failures consistently
2. **Continuous Learning**: Performing thorough post-incident analysis to prevent recurrence
3. **Functional Validation**: Testing that all system functions work correctly under various conditions
4. **Performance Validation**: Ensuring the system meets performance requirements under load
5. **Resilience Testing**: Using chaos engineering to proactively identify weaknesses
