<div class="pillar-header">
  <h1>Reliability Pillar</h1>
  <p>The reliability pillar focuses on ensuring a workload performs its intended function correctly and consistently when it's expected to. This includes the ability to operate and test the workload through its total lifecycle.</p>
</div>

The Reliability pillar includes the ability to support development and run workloads effectively, gain insight into their operations, and to continuously improve supporting processes and procedures to deliver business value.

## Key Areas

The Reliability pillar includes the following key areas:

- **Foundations** - Managing service quotas and network topology
- **Workload Architecture** - Designing distributed systems that withstand failures
- **Change Management** - Monitoring resources and implementing controlled changes
- **Failure Management** - Backing up data, designing for fault isolation, and planning for disaster recovery

## Questions

The AWS Well-Architected Framework provides a set of questions that allows you to review an existing or proposed architecture. It also provides a set of AWS best practices for each pillar.
