<h1>REL08: How do you implement change?</h1>
<p>Controlled change implementation is essential for maintaining system reliability while enabling continuous improvement and feature delivery. You must implement changes in a predictable and controlled manner with appropriate testing, deployment practices, and rollback mechanisms to ensure system stability and minimize risk to users.</p>
</div>

## Overview

Implementing change safely and reliably is fundamental to modern software development and operations. Organizations need to balance the speed of innovation with system stability, ensuring that changes can be deployed frequently without compromising reliability. This requires implementing robust change management processes, automated deployment pipelines, comprehensive testing strategies, and effective rollback mechanisms that enable rapid, safe deployments while maintaining high availability.

## Key Concepts

### Change Implementation Principles

**Controlled Deployment**: Implement changes through controlled, repeatable processes that minimize risk and ensure predictable outcomes through automation and standardization.

**Progressive Rollout**: Deploy changes gradually using techniques like blue-green deployments, canary releases, and feature flags to limit blast radius and enable quick rollback if issues arise.

**Comprehensive Testing**: Validate changes through multiple layers of testing including functional, performance, security, and resiliency testing before production deployment.

**Immutable Infrastructure**: Use infrastructure as code and immutable deployment patterns to ensure consistency, repeatability, and reliable rollback capabilities.

### Foundational Change Elements

**Automated Pipelines**: Implement fully automated CI/CD pipelines that handle building, testing, and deploying changes with minimal manual intervention and maximum consistency.

**Runbook Automation**: Convert manual operational procedures into automated runbooks that ensure consistent execution and reduce human error during deployments.

**Monitoring Integration**: Integrate comprehensive monitoring and alerting into deployment processes to quickly detect issues and trigger automated responses or rollbacks.

**Rollback Capabilities**: Design and implement rapid rollback mechanisms that can quickly restore previous versions when issues are detected during or after deployment.
