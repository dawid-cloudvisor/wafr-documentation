# REL08: How do you implement change?

Controlled change implementation is essential for maintaining system reliability while enabling continuous improvement and feature delivery. Effective change management ensures that modifications to your workload are deployed safely, with minimal risk to system stability and user experience.

Modern change implementation requires automated deployment pipelines, comprehensive testing strategies, gradual rollout mechanisms, and robust rollback capabilities. By implementing these practices, organizations can achieve rapid, reliable deployments while maintaining high availability and system integrity.

## Best Practices

- [REL08-BP01: Use runbooks for standard activities such as deployment](./REL08-BP01.html)
- [REL08-BP02: Integrate functional testing as part of your deployment](./REL08-BP02.html)
- [REL08-BP03: Integrate resiliency testing as part of your deployment](./REL08-BP03.html)
- [REL08-BP04: Deploy using immutable infrastructure](./REL08-BP04.html)
- [REL08-BP05: Deploy changes with automation](./REL08-BP05.html)

## Implementation Approach

### 1. Establish Change Management Framework
- Define change categories and approval processes
- Implement change advisory boards and governance
- Establish risk assessment and impact analysis procedures
- Design change scheduling and coordination mechanisms

### 2. Implement Automated Deployment Pipelines
- Design CI/CD pipelines with automated testing and validation
- Implement infrastructure as code and configuration management
- Establish artifact management and version control
- Configure automated security scanning and compliance checks

### 3. Design Progressive Deployment Strategies
- Implement blue-green deployments for zero-downtime releases
- Configure canary deployments for gradual rollouts
- Design feature flags and toggle mechanisms
- Establish A/B testing and experimentation frameworks

### 4. Establish Testing and Validation
- Implement comprehensive automated testing suites
- Configure performance and load testing in pipelines
- Design chaos engineering and resiliency testing
- Establish production monitoring and validation

### 5. Configure Rollback and Recovery
- Implement automated rollback mechanisms
- Design database migration and rollback strategies
- Establish incident response and emergency procedures
- Configure monitoring and alerting for deployment issues

### 6. Monitor and Optimize Deployment Performance
- Track deployment frequency and lead times
- Monitor change failure rates and recovery times
- Implement continuous improvement processes
- Establish deployment metrics and KPIs

## Key Considerations

- **Deployment Frequency**: Balance speed with safety through automated validation
- **Change Impact**: Assess and minimize the blast radius of changes
- **Testing Coverage**: Ensure comprehensive testing across all change types
- **Rollback Speed**: Implement rapid rollback capabilities for quick recovery
- **Monitoring Integration**: Comprehensive monitoring during and after deployments
- **Team Coordination**: Effective communication and coordination across teams
- **Compliance Requirements**: Meet regulatory and security compliance needs
- **Documentation**: Maintain accurate documentation and change records
