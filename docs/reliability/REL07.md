# REL07: How do you design your workload to adapt to changes in demand?

Resources are provisioned in a planned manner to handle varying demand patterns effectively. Modern workloads must be designed to automatically adapt to changes in demand through intelligent scaling, resource optimization, and proactive capacity management. This ensures optimal performance during peak periods while maintaining cost efficiency during low-demand periods.

Effective demand adaptation requires a combination of automated scaling mechanisms, predictive capacity planning, real-time resource provisioning, and comprehensive load testing. By implementing these practices, workloads can maintain consistent performance and availability regardless of demand fluctuations.

## Best Practices

- [REL07-BP01: Use auto scaling or on-demand resources](./REL07-BP01.html)
- [REL07-BP02: Obtain resources upon detection of impairment to a workload](./REL07-BP02.html)
- [REL07-BP03: Obtain resources upon detection that more resources are needed for a workload](./REL07-BP03.html)
- [REL07-BP04: Load test your workload](./REL07-BP04.html)

## Implementation Approach

### 1. Demand Pattern Analysis
- Analyze historical usage patterns and seasonal variations
- Identify peak demand periods and resource requirements
- Understand application behavior under different load conditions
- Establish baseline performance metrics and capacity requirements

### 2. Scaling Strategy Design
- Implement horizontal and vertical scaling mechanisms
- Design predictive scaling based on historical patterns
- Configure reactive scaling based on real-time metrics
- Establish scaling policies and thresholds

### 3. Resource Optimization
- Implement efficient resource allocation and deallocation
- Design cost-effective scaling strategies
- Optimize resource utilization during different demand periods
- Establish resource pooling and sharing mechanisms

### 4. Testing and Validation
- Conduct comprehensive load testing across demand scenarios
- Validate scaling behavior under various conditions
- Test failure scenarios and recovery mechanisms
- Establish continuous testing and monitoring processes

## Key Considerations

- **Scaling Velocity**: Ensure scaling actions occur quickly enough to meet demand changes
- **Cost Optimization**: Balance performance requirements with cost efficiency
- **Resource Limits**: Understand and plan for service limits and quotas
- **Application Architecture**: Design applications to support horizontal scaling
- **Data Consistency**: Maintain data consistency during scaling operations
- **Monitoring Integration**: Implement comprehensive monitoring for scaling decisions

## AWS Services to Consider

### Auto Scaling Services
- **Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling**: Automatic scaling of EC2 instances based on demand
- **AWS Auto Scaling**: Unified scaling across multiple AWS services
- **Amazon ECS Service Auto Scaling**: Container-based application scaling
- **Amazon EKS Cluster Autoscaler**: Kubernetes node scaling

### Serverless and On-Demand Services
- **AWS Lambda**: Serverless compute that scales automatically
- **Amazon API Gateway**: Managed API service with automatic scaling
- **AWS Fargate**: Serverless containers with automatic scaling
- **Amazon DynamoDB**: NoSQL database with on-demand scaling

### Load Balancing and Distribution
- **Elastic Load Balancing**: Distribute traffic across multiple targets
- **Amazon CloudFront**: Global content delivery with edge scaling
- **AWS Global Accelerator**: Improve performance with global network
- **Amazon Route 53**: DNS-based traffic routing and health checks

### Monitoring and Analytics
- **Amazon CloudWatch**: Metrics, alarms, and scaling triggers
- **AWS X-Ray**: Application performance monitoring and analysis
- **Amazon Kinesis**: Real-time data streaming and processing
- **AWS CloudTrail**: API call logging and audit trails
