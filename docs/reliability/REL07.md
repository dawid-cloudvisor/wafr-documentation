<h1>REL07: How do you design your workload to adapt to changes in demand?</h1>
<p>A scalable workload provides elasticity to add or remove resources automatically so that they closely match the current demand at any given point in time. Resources are provisioned in a planned manner to handle varying demand patterns effectively, ensuring optimal performance during peak periods while maintaining cost efficiency during low-demand periods.</p>
</div>

## Overview

Designing workloads that can adapt to changes in demand is essential for maintaining performance, availability, and cost efficiency in dynamic environments. Modern applications experience varying load patterns due to business cycles, seasonal changes, marketing campaigns, and unexpected events. Effective demand adaptation involves implementing automated scaling mechanisms, predictive capacity planning, intelligent resource provisioning, and comprehensive testing to ensure systems can handle both expected and unexpected demand changes.

## Key Concepts

### Demand Adaptation Principles

**Elastic Scaling**: Design systems that can automatically scale resources up or down based on demand, ensuring optimal performance while minimizing costs during low-demand periods.

**Predictive Capacity Planning**: Use historical data and business intelligence to anticipate demand changes and proactively provision resources before they're needed.

**Real-time Responsiveness**: Implement monitoring and scaling mechanisms that can detect and respond to demand changes in real-time, preventing performance degradation.

**Cost Optimization**: Balance performance requirements with cost efficiency by implementing intelligent scaling policies that optimize resource utilization.

### Foundational Scaling Elements

**Auto Scaling Mechanisms**: Implement automated scaling policies that can add or remove resources based on predefined metrics and thresholds without manual intervention.

**Load Distribution**: Use load balancing and traffic distribution mechanisms to efficiently distribute demand across available resources and prevent hotspots.

**Resource Provisioning**: Design systems that can quickly provision and deprovision resources to match demand patterns while maintaining application state and consistency.

**Performance Testing**: Conduct comprehensive load testing to understand system behavior under various demand scenarios and validate scaling mechanisms.
