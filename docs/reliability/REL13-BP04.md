# REL13-BP04: Manage configuration drift at the DR site or region

Implement processes to prevent and detect configuration drift between production and disaster recovery environments. Use infrastructure as code, automated synchronization, and continuous monitoring to maintain consistency and ensure DR environments remain viable for recovery operations.

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Implement Infrastructure as Code
Use infrastructure as code to ensure consistent deployment across production and DR environments.

### 2. Establish Configuration Baselines
Define and maintain configuration baselines for all components in both environments.

### 3. Implement Automated Synchronization
Set up automated processes to synchronize configurations between environments.

### 4. Monitor for Configuration Drift
Continuously monitor for differences between production and DR configurations.

### 5. Remediate Drift Automatically
Implement automated remediation processes to correct configuration drift when detected.

## AWS Services

### Primary Services
- **AWS Config**: Configuration compliance and drift detection
- **AWS CloudFormation**: Infrastructure as code for consistent deployments
- **AWS Systems Manager**: Configuration management and automation
- **AWS CodePipeline**: Automated deployment pipelines for DR environments

### Supporting Services
- **Amazon EventBridge**: Event-driven configuration synchronization
- **AWS Lambda**: Automated drift remediation functions
