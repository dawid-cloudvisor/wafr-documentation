<h1>REL10: How do you use fault isolation to protect your workload?</h1>
<p>Fault isolation limits the scope of impact when failures occur. By implementing fault isolation strategies, you can prevent failures in one component from cascading to other parts of your workload, maintaining system availability and enabling graceful degradation during partial outages.</p>
</div>

## Overview

Fault isolation is a fundamental design principle that prevents failures from propagating throughout your system, limiting the blast radius of incidents and maintaining overall system availability. Effective fault isolation involves implementing multiple layers of protection including geographic distribution, service boundaries, resource isolation, and automated recovery mechanisms. This approach ensures that when failures inevitably occur, they remain contained and don't compromise the entire workload.

## Key Concepts

### Fault Isolation Principles

**Failure Containment**: Design systems so that failures in one component don't cascade to other components, limiting the scope of impact and maintaining overall system functionality.

**Geographic Distribution**: Deploy workloads across multiple locations including regions and availability zones to protect against location-specific failures and disasters.

**Service Boundaries**: Implement clear service boundaries and bulkhead patterns that isolate failures within specific services or components.

**Resource Isolation**: Separate critical resources and processes to prevent resource contention and ensure that failures in one area don't affect others.

### Foundational Isolation Elements

**Multi-Location Deployment**: Distribute workload components across multiple geographic locations to protect against regional failures and provide disaster recovery capabilities.

**Automated Recovery**: Implement automated detection and recovery mechanisms for components that must remain in single locations due to constraints.

**Circuit Breakers**: Use circuit breaker patterns to prevent cascading failures and provide fallback mechanisms when dependencies fail.

**Bulkhead Patterns**: Isolate critical resources using separate pools, queues, and processing capacity to prevent resource exhaustion.
