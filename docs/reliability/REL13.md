# REL13: How do you plan for disaster recovery?

Disaster recovery (DR) planning ensures your workload can recover from natural disasters, large-scale technical failures, or human threats. A comprehensive DR strategy includes defining recovery objectives, implementing appropriate recovery strategies, regular testing, configuration management, and automation to minimize downtime and data loss.

## Implementation Approach

Effective disaster recovery planning requires a systematic approach that balances business requirements with technical capabilities and cost considerations. The strategy focuses on:

1. **Clear Recovery Objectives**: Define specific RTO (Recovery Time Objective) and RPO (Recovery Point Objective) requirements
2. **Appropriate Recovery Strategies**: Choose the right DR strategy based on criticality and cost constraints
3. **Regular Testing**: Validate DR procedures through regular testing and exercises
4. **Configuration Management**: Ensure DR environments remain synchronized with production
5. **Automation**: Implement automated recovery processes to reduce human error and recovery time
