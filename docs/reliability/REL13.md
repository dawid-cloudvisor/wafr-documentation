<h1>REL13: How do you plan for disaster recovery?</h1>
<p>Disaster recovery (DR) planning ensures your workload can recover from natural disasters, large-scale technical failures, or human threats. Define recovery objectives, implement appropriate recovery strategies, test regularly, manage configuration drift, and automate recovery to minimize downtime and data loss.</p>
</div>

## Overview

Disaster recovery planning is critical for maintaining business continuity when facing significant disruptions that could impact your entire workload or infrastructure. Effective DR planning goes beyond simple backup strategies to include comprehensive recovery procedures, automated failover mechanisms, and regular testing to ensure systems can be restored within defined objectives. This involves careful analysis of business requirements, selection of appropriate recovery strategies, and implementation of automated systems that can respond quickly to disaster scenarios.

## Key Concepts

### Disaster Recovery Principles

**Recovery Objectives Definition**: Establish clear Recovery Time Objectives (RTO) and Recovery Point Objectives (RPO) that align with business requirements and drive DR strategy decisions.

**Comprehensive Recovery Strategies**: Implement appropriate DR strategies ranging from backup and restore to multi-site active-active configurations based on criticality and recovery objectives.

**Regular Testing and Validation**: Conduct systematic testing of DR procedures to ensure they work as expected and can meet defined recovery objectives under real conditions.

**Configuration Management**: Maintain consistency between production and DR environments to prevent configuration drift that could impact recovery effectiveness.

### Foundational DR Elements

**Business Impact Analysis**: Understand the business impact of different types of disasters and outages to prioritize recovery efforts and resource allocation.

**Recovery Strategy Selection**: Choose appropriate DR strategies based on criticality, recovery objectives, and cost considerations for different workload components.

**Automated Recovery**: Implement automated recovery mechanisms that can detect disasters and initiate recovery procedures without manual intervention.

**Cross-Region Architecture**: Design workloads that can operate across multiple regions to provide geographic separation and disaster isolation.
