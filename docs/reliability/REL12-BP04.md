# REL12-BP04: Test scaling and performance requirements

Validate system performance under expected and peak load conditions. Test auto-scaling behavior, resource limits, and performance degradation patterns to ensure SLA compliance and optimal user experience.

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Define Performance Baselines
Establish performance benchmarks and SLA requirements for different load scenarios.

### 2. Implement Load Testing
Create comprehensive load tests that simulate realistic user traffic patterns.

### 3. Test Auto-Scaling Behavior
Validate that auto-scaling mechanisms respond appropriately to load changes.

### 4. Perform Stress Testing
Test system behavior under extreme load conditions to identify breaking points.

### 5. Monitor and Analyze Results
Collect detailed performance metrics and analyze system behavior under load.
