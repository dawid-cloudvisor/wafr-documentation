<h1>REL05: How do you design interactions in a distributed system to mitigate or withstand failures?</h1>
<p>Distributed systems rely on communications networks where there can be latency and unreliability issues. This is why you must implement strategies to reduce and mitigate these issues. By identifying your dependencies and implementing the patterns described in this question, you can prevent many types of distributed system failures.</p>
</div>

## Overview

Designing interactions that can mitigate and withstand failures is critical for building resilient distributed systems. While REL04 focuses on preventing failures, REL05 addresses how to handle failures when they inevitably occur. This involves implementing patterns like graceful degradation, throttling, retry mechanisms, circuit breakers, and stateless design to ensure that your system can continue operating even when individual components fail or become unavailable.

## Key Concepts

### Failure Mitigation Principles

**Graceful Degradation**: Design systems to continue operating with reduced functionality when dependencies fail, rather than failing completely. This ensures core business functions remain available even during partial system failures.

**Throttling and Rate Limiting**: Implement mechanisms to control the rate of requests to prevent system overload and protect downstream services from being overwhelmed during traffic spikes or cascading failures.

**Retry Strategies**: Design intelligent retry mechanisms with exponential backoff and jitter to handle transient failures while avoiding thundering herd problems that can worsen system conditions.

**Circuit Breaking**: Implement circuit breaker patterns that automatically stop calling failing services, allowing them time to recover while preventing cascading failures throughout the system.

### Foundational Resilience Patterns

**Stateless Design**: Build services that don't maintain session state, enabling easy horizontal scaling and simplifying failure recovery by allowing any instance to handle any request.

**Bulkhead Isolation**: Isolate critical resources and processes to prevent failures in one area from affecting other parts of the system, similar to watertight compartments in ships.

**Timeout Management**: Implement appropriate timeouts for all external calls to prevent resource exhaustion and ensure that slow or unresponsive services don't impact overall system performance.

**Emergency Levers**: Provide mechanisms to quickly disable non-essential features or redirect traffic during emergencies, allowing operators to maintain core functionality under extreme conditions.
