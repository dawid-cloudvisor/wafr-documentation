<div class="pillar-header">
  <h1>Sustainability Pillar</h1>
  <p>The sustainability pillar focuses on minimizing the environmental impacts of running cloud workloads. Key topics include a shared responsibility model for sustainability, understanding impact, and maximizing utilization to minimize required resources and reduce downstream impacts.</p>
</div>

The Sustainability pillar includes the ability to support development and run workloads effectively, gain insight into their operations, and to continuously improve supporting processes and procedures to deliver business value.

## Key Areas

The Sustainability pillar includes the following key areas:

- **Region Selection** - Choosing Regions with lower carbon footprints
- **User Behavior Patterns** - Aligning user needs with sustainable practices
- **Software and Architecture Patterns** - Designing efficient applications
- **Data Patterns** - Implementing lifecycle policies and storage tiering
- **Hardware Patterns** - Using the minimum amount of hardware to meet your needs
- **Development and Deployment Process** - Optimizing development and testing environments

## Questions

The AWS Well-Architected Framework provides a set of questions that allows you to review an existing or proposed architecture. It also provides a set of AWS best practices for each pillar.
