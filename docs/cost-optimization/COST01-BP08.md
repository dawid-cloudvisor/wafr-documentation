  <h1>COST01-BP08: Create a cost-aware culture</h1>
  <p>Establish a culture where cost optimization is everyone's responsibility, not just the finance team's. Implement training programs, incentives, and recognition systems that encourage cost-conscious behavior across all teams. Make cost awareness part of daily operations and decision-making processes.</p>
</div>

## Implementation guidance

Creating a cost-aware culture requires transforming how the entire organization thinks about and approaches cloud costs. This involves education, incentives, processes, and leadership commitment to make cost optimization a shared responsibility and core organizational value.
