  <h1>COST01-BP03: Establish cloud budgets and forecasts</h1>
  <p>Establish budgets for your workloads and monitor costs against these budgets. Use forecasting to predict future costs and identify potential budget overruns early. Budgets should be established at multiple levels (account, service, project, team) and regularly reviewed and updated based on business changes and historical performance.</p>
</div>

## Implementation guidance

Effective budgeting and forecasting are fundamental to cloud financial management. They provide the framework for planning, monitoring, and controlling cloud costs while enabling proactive decision-making and preventing unexpected cost overruns.

### Key steps for implementing this best practice:

1. **Define budget structure and hierarchy**:
   - Establish budgets at multiple organizational levels (account, business unit, project, team)
   - Align budget structure with cost allocation and organizational responsibility
   - Create both aggregate and detailed budget views
   - Implement budget inheritance and rollup mechanisms

2. **Implement comprehensive budget types**:
   - **Cost Budgets**: Track actual spending against planned amounts
   - **Usage Budgets**: Monitor resource consumption and utilization
   - **Reservation Budgets**: Track Reserved Instance and Savings Plan utilization
   - **Credit Budgets**: Monitor AWS credits and promotional balances

3. **Establish forecasting methodologies**:
   - Use historical data analysis for trend-based forecasting
   - Implement business driver-based forecasting for growth scenarios
   - Create scenario planning for different business conditions
   - Integrate capacity planning with cost forecasting

4. **Configure proactive monitoring and alerting**:
   - Set up budget alerts at multiple thresholds (50%, 80%, 100%, 120%)
   - Implement forecasted budget alerts for early warning
   - Configure different alert recipients based on budget levels and thresholds
   - Establish escalation procedures for budget overruns

5. **Create regular review and update processes**:
   - Schedule monthly budget performance reviews
   - Implement quarterly budget reforecasting processes
   - Conduct annual budget planning and approval cycles
   - Establish variance analysis and explanation procedures

6. **Integrate with business planning processes**:
   - Align cloud budgets with overall business budgets and planning cycles
   - Include cloud costs in project and initiative business cases
   - Integrate capacity planning with business growth projections
   - Coordinate with procurement and vendor management processes

## Budget structure and hierarchy

### Multi-level Budget Framework

**Organizational Level Budgets**:
- **Enterprise Budget**: Total cloud spending across all accounts and services
- **Business Unit Budgets**: Costs allocated to specific business units or divisions
- **Department Budgets**: Costs for individual departments or functional areas
- **Team Budgets**: Costs for specific development or operational teams

**Technical Level Budgets**:
- **Account Budgets**: Spending limits for individual AWS accounts
- **Service Budgets**: Costs for specific AWS services (EC2, S3, RDS, etc.)
- **Environment Budgets**: Costs for different environments (production, staging, development)
- **Workload Budgets**: Costs for specific applications or workloads

**Project Level Budgets**:
- **Initiative Budgets**: Costs for specific business initiatives or projects
- **Feature Budgets**: Costs for individual features or capabilities
- **Campaign Budgets**: Costs for marketing campaigns or time-limited activities
- **Experiment Budgets**: Costs for proof-of-concepts and pilot projects

### Budget Allocation Strategies

**Top-down Allocation**:
- Start with total available budget
- Allocate to business units based on strategic priorities
- Further allocate to teams and projects
- Ensure alignment with business objectives

**Bottom-up Allocation**:
- Start with individual project and team requirements
- Aggregate to department and business unit levels
- Validate against available budget and priorities
- Adjust based on constraints and trade-offs

**Hybrid Allocation**:
- Combine top-down strategic allocation with bottom-up requirements
- Use historical data and growth projections
- Include buffer for unexpected needs and opportunities
- Regular reconciliation and adjustment processes

## Forecasting methodologies

### Historical Trend Analysis

**Time Series Forecasting**:
- Analyze historical cost patterns and trends
- Account for seasonality and cyclical patterns
- Use statistical methods (moving averages, exponential smoothing)
- Adjust for known changes and anomalies

**Growth Rate Projections**:
- Calculate historical growth rates by service and workload
- Apply growth rates to current baseline costs
- Adjust for business changes and market conditions
- Include confidence intervals and scenario analysis

### Business Driver-Based Forecasting

**Usage-Based Forecasting**:
- Identify key business metrics that drive cloud costs
- Establish relationships between business metrics and costs
- Project business metrics based on business plans
- Calculate corresponding cost projections

**Capacity Planning Integration**:
- Align forecasting with infrastructure capacity planning
- Include planned architecture changes and optimizations
- Account for new projects and initiatives
- Consider technology refresh and migration impacts

### Scenario Planning

**Base Case Scenario**:
- Most likely business and cost outcome
- Based on current trends and approved plans
- Includes known changes and initiatives
- Primary scenario for budget planning

**Optimistic Scenario**:
- Higher growth and increased resource needs
- Accelerated project timelines and new opportunities
- Higher confidence in cost optimization success
- Used for capacity planning and risk assessment

**Pessimistic Scenario**:
- Lower growth and cost optimization challenges
- Delayed projects and reduced business activity
- Conservative assumptions about savings and efficiency
- Used for contingency planning and risk management
