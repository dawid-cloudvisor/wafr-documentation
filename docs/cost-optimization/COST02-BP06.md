  <h1>COST02-BP06: Track project lifecycle</h1>
  <p>Track the complete lifecycle of projects and workloads to ensure resources are appropriately managed from inception through decommissioning. Effective lifecycle tracking enables proactive cost management, ensures resources are right-sized for each phase, and prevents orphaned resources from accumulating costs after projects end.</p>
</div>

## Implementation guidance

Project lifecycle tracking is essential for maintaining cost control and ensuring resources are used efficiently throughout their entire lifespan. This includes planning, development, testing, production, and eventual decommissioning phases, each with different cost profiles and requirements.

### Lifecycle Management Principles

**Phase-Appropriate Resourcing**: Ensure resources are sized and configured appropriately for each project phase, with different requirements for development, testing, staging, and production environments.

**Proactive Planning**: Plan resource needs and costs for the entire project lifecycle upfront, including decommissioning activities and data retention requirements.

**Continuous Monitoring**: Monitor resource usage and costs throughout the project lifecycle, adjusting allocations based on actual needs and changing requirements.

**Automated Transitions**: Implement automated processes for transitioning resources between lifecycle phases and for decommissioning resources when projects end.

### Project Lifecycle Phases

**Planning Phase**: Establish cost estimates, resource requirements, and governance frameworks before project implementation begins.

**Development Phase**: Provision development resources with appropriate cost controls and monitoring, typically with more flexible but limited resource allocations.

**Testing Phase**: Scale resources for testing activities while maintaining cost efficiency, often requiring temporary increases in capacity.

**Production Phase**: Deploy production resources with appropriate performance, availability, and cost optimization measures in place.

**Maintenance Phase**: Ongoing optimization and right-sizing of resources based on actual usage patterns and changing business requirements.

**Decommissioning Phase**: Systematic shutdown and cleanup of resources when projects end, including data archival and compliance requirements.

### Lifecycle Tracking Components

**Resource Inventory**: Maintain comprehensive inventory of all resources associated with each project, including dependencies and relationships.

**Cost Attribution**: Ensure all costs are properly attributed to projects and tracked throughout their lifecycle.

**Usage Monitoring**: Monitor resource utilization patterns to identify optimization opportunities and lifecycle transitions.

**Compliance Tracking**: Track compliance requirements that may change throughout the project lifecycle, such as data retention and security requirements.

## Lifecycle Governance and Compliance

### Lifecycle Policies

**Phase Transition Policies**: Define criteria and approval requirements for transitioning between lifecycle phases.

**Resource Retention Policies**: Specify how long resources should be retained in each phase and when they should be decommissioned.

**Cost Optimization Policies**: Require regular cost optimization reviews and actions during each lifecycle phase.

**Compliance Policies**: Ensure compliance requirements are met throughout the project lifecycle, including data retention and security requirements.

### Approval Workflows

**Phase Transition Approvals**: Require appropriate approvals for moving projects between lifecycle phases, especially to production and decommissioning.

**Resource Scaling Approvals**: Require approval for significant resource scaling activities that impact costs.

**Decommissioning Approvals**: Implement formal approval processes for project decommissioning to ensure proper data handling and compliance.

**Exception Approvals**: Create processes for approving exceptions to standard lifecycle management policies.

### Compliance Monitoring

**Lifecycle Compliance Tracking**: Monitor compliance with lifecycle management policies and procedures.

**Resource Tagging Compliance**: Ensure all resources are properly tagged with lifecycle information.

**Cost Allocation Compliance**: Verify that costs are properly allocated to projects and lifecycle phases.

**Data Retention Compliance**: Monitor compliance with data retention requirements throughout the lifecycle.
