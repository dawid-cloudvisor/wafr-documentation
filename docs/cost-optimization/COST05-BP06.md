  <h1>COST05-BP06: Implement processes to regularly evaluate new services</h1>
  <p>Establish systematic processes to continuously evaluate new AWS services, features, and pricing models that could provide better cost optimization opportunities. Regular evaluation ensures you take advantage of AWS innovations and evolving cost optimization options.</p>
</div>

## Implementation guidance

Regular evaluation of new services involves establishing systematic processes to stay current with AWS service innovations, pricing changes, and new cost optimization opportunities. This proactive approach ensures your organization can quickly adopt new services that provide better cost-effectiveness.

### Continuous Service Evaluation

**Service Monitoring**: Stay informed about new AWS service launches, feature updates, and pricing changes that could impact your cost optimization strategy.

**Opportunity Assessment**: Regularly assess how new services could replace or complement existing solutions to reduce costs or improve efficiency.

**Pilot Programs**: Implement structured pilot programs to test new services in controlled environments before full adoption.

**Cost-Benefit Analysis**: Perform systematic cost-benefit analysis for new services considering migration costs, operational changes, and long-term benefits.

### Evaluation Framework

**Regular Review Cycles**: Establish quarterly or bi-annual review cycles to evaluate new services and opportunities.

**Cross-functional Teams**: Involve technical, financial, and business stakeholders in evaluation processes to ensure comprehensive assessment.

**Standardized Criteria**: Use consistent evaluation criteria and frameworks to compare new services against existing solutions.

**Decision Documentation**: Document evaluation decisions and rationale to build organizational knowledge and improve future evaluations.

## Service Evaluation Templates

### New Service Evaluation Template
```yaml
New_Service_Evaluation:
  service_name: "Amazon Aurora Serverless v2"
  evaluation_id: "EVAL-2024-001"
  evaluation_date: "2024-01-15"
  evaluator: "Cloud Architecture Team"
  
  service_details:
    category: "Database"
    announcement_date: "2024-01-10"
    general_availability: "2024-02-01"
    description: "Serverless relational database with instant scaling"
    key_features:
      - "Instant scaling from 0.5 to 128 ACUs"
      - "Pay only for capacity used"
      - "Compatible with MySQL and PostgreSQL"
      - "Automatic pause and resume"
      
  current_state_analysis:
    relevant_workloads:
      - "Development databases (15 RDS instances)"
      - "Staging environments (8 RDS instances)"
      - "Analytics workloads (variable usage)"
    current_monthly_cost: 4500
    pain_points:
      - "Over-provisioned development databases"
      - "Manual scaling for variable workloads"
      - "High costs for infrequently used environments"
      
  evaluation_scores:
    business_value: 0.85
    technical_feasibility: 0.90
    cost_impact: 0.80
    strategic_alignment: 0.75
    migration_complexity: 0.70
    overall_score: 0.80
    
  cost_analysis:
    estimated_monthly_savings: 1350  # 30% reduction
    migration_cost: 5000
    payback_period_months: 4
    three_year_savings: 43200
    
  pilot_program:
    scope: "Migrate 3 development databases"
    duration: "8 weeks"
    success_criteria:
      - "Cost reduction >= 25%"
      - "Performance equivalent or better"
      - "No application compatibility issues"
      - "Operational complexity acceptable"
    resources_required:
      - "1 database engineer (50% time)"
      - "1 application developer (25% time)"
      - "AWS support engagement"
      
  recommendation: "Proceed with pilot program"
  rationale: |
    Aurora Serverless v2 shows strong potential for cost optimization
    in our development and variable workload scenarios. High scores
    across all evaluation criteria and clear cost savings justify
    proceeding with a structured pilot program.
    
  next_steps:
    - "Create detailed pilot implementation plan"
    - "Set up monitoring and cost tracking"
    - "Begin pilot with lowest-risk development database"
    - "Schedule weekly progress reviews"
    
  risks_and_mitigations:
    - risk: "Application compatibility issues"
      mitigation: "Thorough testing in isolated environment"
    - risk: "Performance degradation"
      mitigation: "Comprehensive benchmarking and monitoring"
    - risk: "Operational complexity"
      mitigation: "Training and documentation development"

## Common Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge: Information Overload from New Service Announcements

**Solution**: Implement filtering and prioritization mechanisms. Focus on services relevant to your current architecture and cost optimization goals. Use automated tools to screen and categorize new services.

### Challenge: Limited Resources for Evaluation

**Solution**: Prioritize evaluations based on potential impact and strategic alignment. Create lightweight evaluation processes for initial screening. Use cross-functional teams to share evaluation workload.

### Challenge: Keeping Up with Rapid Service Evolution

**Solution**: Establish regular review cycles and automated monitoring. Subscribe to relevant AWS communication channels. Build relationships with AWS account teams for early insights.

### Challenge: Balancing Innovation with Stability

**Solution**: Use structured pilot programs to test new services safely. Implement gradual adoption strategies. Maintain clear criteria for when to adopt new services versus maintaining current solutions.

### Challenge: Measuring Success of New Service Adoption

**Solution**: Define clear success metrics before adoption. Implement comprehensive monitoring and tracking. Conduct post-adoption reviews to capture lessons learned and improve future evaluations.
