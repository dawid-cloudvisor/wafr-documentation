  <h1>COST02-BP02: Implement goals and targets</h1>
  <p>Implement both cost and usage goals and targets for your workload. Goals provide direction and motivation for cost optimization efforts, while targets provide specific, measurable objectives that teams can work toward. Regular tracking and reporting against these goals and targets enables continuous improvement and accountability.</p>
</div>

## Implementation guidance

Effective cost governance requires clear, measurable goals and targets that align with business objectives and provide direction for optimization efforts. These goals should be specific, achievable, and regularly monitored to ensure progress and accountability.

### Goal Setting Framework

**SMART Goals**: Establish goals that are Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. This ensures clarity and enables effective tracking and accountability.

**Hierarchical Structure**: Create goals at multiple levels - organizational, business unit, project, and workload levels - ensuring alignment and cascading accountability throughout the organization.

**Business Alignment**: Ensure all cost and usage goals directly support broader business objectives such as profitability, growth, efficiency, or competitive positioning.

**Stakeholder Involvement**: Engage relevant stakeholders in goal setting to ensure buy-in, realistic expectations, and comprehensive coverage of all important aspects.

### Types of Goals and Targets

**Cost Reduction Goals**: Specific targets for reducing overall costs or costs in particular areas, such as "Reduce compute costs by 15% over the next 12 months."

**Efficiency Targets**: Goals focused on improving cost efficiency metrics, such as cost per transaction, cost per user, or cost per unit of business value delivered.

**Usage Optimization Goals**: Targets for improving resource utilization, such as achieving specific CPU utilization rates or reducing idle resources by a certain percentage.

**Budget Adherence Targets**: Goals for staying within allocated budgets and improving budget accuracy and predictability over time.

### Goal Implementation Strategy

**Baseline Establishment**: Establish clear baselines for all metrics before setting improvement targets. Use historical data and current state analysis to create accurate starting points.

**Progressive Targets**: Set incremental targets that build toward larger objectives, allowing for learning and adjustment while maintaining momentum and motivation.

**Resource Allocation**: Ensure adequate resources (people, tools, time) are allocated to achieve the established goals and targets.

**Accountability Assignment**: Clearly assign ownership and accountability for each goal to specific individuals or teams, with defined roles and responsibilities.

### 3. Set Specific Targets
- Use baseline data to set realistic but challenging targets
- Consider business growth projections and changing requirements
- Set both short-term (quarterly) and long-term (annual) targets
- Include stretch goals to encourage innovation and exceptional performance

### 4. Assign Ownership and Accountability
- Clearly assign responsibility for each goal to specific individuals or teams
- Define roles and responsibilities for goal achievement
- Establish escalation procedures for goals at risk
- Create incentive structures that align with goal achievement

### 5. Implement Monitoring and Reporting
- Set up automated monitoring and alerting for key metrics
- Create regular reporting schedules and formats
- Establish review meetings and governance processes
- Implement dashboard and visualization tools for stakeholder visibility

### 6. Create Action Plans
- Develop specific action plans for achieving each goal
- Identify required resources, tools, and capabilities
