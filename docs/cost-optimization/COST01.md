# COST01: How do you implement cloud financial management?

Implementing Cloud Financial Management enables organizations to realize business value and financial success as they optimize their cost and usage and scale on AWS.

## Best Practices

### Establish a cost optimization function
Create a team that is responsible for establishing and maintaining cost awareness across your organization. The team requires people from finance, technology, and business roles across the organization.

### Establish a partnership between finance and technology
Establish a partnership between finance and technology teams, and work together towards business objectives. Teams work together on strategic decisions and day-to-day operations. Common activities include monthly cost reviews, new service implementation planning, and architecture reviews.

### Establish cloud budgets and forecasts
Adjust existing organizational budgeting and forecasting processes to be compatible with the highly variable nature of cloud costs and usage. Processes must be dynamic using trend-based or business driver-based algorithms, or a combination of both.

### Implement cost awareness in your organizational processes
Implement cost awareness into new or existing organizational processes that impact usage, and leverage existing processes for cost awareness. Implement cost awareness into employee training.

### Report and notify on cost optimization
Configure AWS Budgets to provide notifications on cost and usage against targets. Have regular meetings to analyze this workload's cost efficiency and to promote cost aware culture. Implement gamification mechanisms to reward and publicize cost optimization achievements.

### Monitor cost proactively
Implement tooling and dashboards to monitor cost proactively for the workload. Do not just look at costs and categories when you receive notifications. Use AWS Cost Explorer for regular reporting.

### Keep up to date with new service releases
Consult regularly with experts or AWS Partners to consider which services and features provide lower cost. Review AWS blogs and other information sources.

### Implement Cloud Financial Management
Implement Cloud Financial Management to realize business value and financial success as you optimize your costs and usage, and scale on AWS.

## Implementation Guidance

3. **Set up budgets and alerts**: Use AWS Budgets to set cost thresholds and receive alerts when approaching limits.

4. **Create cost visibility**: Implement dashboards using AWS Cost Explorer or third-party tools to provide visibility into costs.

5. **Regular cost reviews**: Schedule regular reviews of your AWS costs to identify optimization opportunities.

6. **Educate teams**: Train teams on cost-efficient cloud usage and make cost optimization part of your culture.
