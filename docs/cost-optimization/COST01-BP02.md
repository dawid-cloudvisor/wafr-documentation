   - Establish joint planning sessions for budgeting and forecasting
   - Implement cross-functional project teams for major initiatives

2. **Define shared responsibilities and accountability**:
   - Create clear roles and responsibilities for cost-related decisions
   - Establish joint ownership of cost optimization outcomes
   - Implement shared metrics and KPIs that both teams contribute to
   - Define escalation paths for cost-related issues and conflicts

3. **Develop shared understanding and language**:
   - Provide cross-training on cloud economics and technical concepts
   - Create shared glossaries and documentation
   - Establish common frameworks for evaluating cost optimization opportunities
   - Implement regular knowledge sharing sessions

4. **Implement collaborative planning processes**:
   - Include both teams in budget planning and forecasting activities
   - Conduct joint architecture reviews with cost considerations
   - Collaborate on capacity planning and resource allocation decisions
   - Establish shared approval processes for significant cost decisions

5. **Create shared tools and visibility**:
   - Implement shared dashboards and reporting tools
   - Provide both teams access to cost and usage data
