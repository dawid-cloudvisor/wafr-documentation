  <h1>COST01-BP05: Report and notify on cost optimization</h1>
  <p>Configure cost optimization reporting and notifications to provide regular visibility into cost performance, optimization opportunities, and achievements. Implement automated reporting that delivers relevant cost information to appropriate stakeholders at the right frequency and level of detail.</p>
</div>

## Implementation guidance

Effective reporting and notification systems are essential for maintaining cost visibility, driving accountability, and enabling data-driven decision making. These systems should provide the right information to the right people at the right time to support effective cost management.

### Key steps for implementing this best practice:

1. **Define reporting requirements and audiences**:
   - Identify different stakeholder groups and their information needs
   - Determine appropriate reporting frequency and formats
   - Define key metrics and KPIs for different audiences
   - Establish reporting standards and templates

2. **Implement automated cost reporting**:
   - Create automated dashboards for real-time cost visibility
   - Implement scheduled reports for regular cost performance updates
   - Configure exception reports for unusual cost patterns
   - Establish trend analysis and forecasting reports

3. **Configure proactive notifications and alerts**:
   - Set up budget alerts and threshold notifications
   - Implement anomaly detection and alerting
   - Configure optimization opportunity notifications
   - Establish escalation procedures for critical cost issues

4. **Create stakeholder-specific reporting**:
   - Executive dashboards with high-level cost performance
   - Operational reports with detailed cost breakdowns
   - Team-level reports with actionable optimization opportunities
   - Project-specific cost tracking and reporting

5. **Implement cost optimization tracking and communication**:
   - Track and report on optimization initiatives and savings
   - Communicate success stories and best practices
   - Report on cost optimization ROI and business value
   - Share lessons learned and improvement opportunities

6. **Establish feedback and improvement processes**:
   - Collect feedback on reporting effectiveness and usefulness
   - Continuously improve reporting based on stakeholder needs
   - Implement self-service reporting capabilities where appropriate
   - Establish regular review and update cycles for reporting systems

## Reporting framework and structure

### Multi-tiered Reporting Approach

**Executive Level Reporting**:
- **Frequency**: Monthly/Quarterly
- **Focus**: Strategic cost performance and trends
- **Metrics**: Total cost, budget variance, cost optimization savings, ROI
- **Format**: High-level dashboards, executive summaries, trend analysis

**Management Level Reporting**:
- **Frequency**: Weekly/Monthly
- **Focus**: Operational cost performance and optimization opportunities
- **Metrics**: Service costs, team costs, project costs, efficiency metrics
- **Format**: Detailed dashboards, variance reports, action plans

**Team Level Reporting**:
- **Frequency**: Daily/Weekly
- **Focus**: Actionable cost information and optimization opportunities
- **Metrics**: Resource utilization, cost per service, optimization recommendations
- **Format**: Operational dashboards, alerts, optimization reports

**Project Level Reporting**:
- **Frequency**: Weekly/Monthly
- **Focus**: Project-specific cost tracking and budget performance
- **Metrics**: Project costs, budget variance, cost per milestone, forecasts
- **Format**: Project dashboards, budget reports, variance analysis

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

**Financial KPIs**:
- Total cloud spend and trends
- Budget variance and accuracy
- Cost per business unit/team/project
- Cost optimization savings achieved
- Return on investment (ROI) for optimization efforts

## Notification and alerting strategies

### Alert Types and Thresholds

**Budget Alerts**:
- **Threshold Alerts**: 50%, 80%, 100%, 120% of budget
- **Forecast Alerts**: Projected to exceed budget by month-end
- **Variance Alerts**: Significant deviation from historical patterns
- **Trend Alerts**: Sustained cost increases over time

**Anomaly Alerts**:
- **Spend Anomalies**: Unusual cost spikes or patterns
- **Usage Anomalies**: Unexpected resource usage changes
- **Service Anomalies**: Unusual costs for specific services
- **Account Anomalies**: Unexpected costs in specific accounts

**Optimization Alerts**:
- **Right-sizing Opportunities**: Oversized or underutilized resources
- **Reserved Instance Opportunities**: Potential for RI purchases
- **Unused Resource Alerts**: Idle or unused resources identified
- **Lifecycle Opportunities**: Storage lifecycle optimization opportunities

### Alert Routing and Escalation

**Primary Recipients**:
- **FinOps Team**: All cost-related alerts and notifications
- **Team Leads**: Team-specific cost alerts and optimization opportunities
- **Project Managers**: Project budget and cost performance alerts
- **Executives**: High-impact cost issues and strategic alerts

**Escalation Procedures**:
```yaml
Alert Escalation Matrix:
  Level 1 - Informational:
    Recipients: FinOps Team, Team Leads
    Response Time: 24 hours
    Actions: Review and assess, implement quick fixes
  
  Level 2 - Warning:
