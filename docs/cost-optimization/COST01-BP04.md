  <h1>COST01-BP04: Implement cost awareness in your organizational processes</h1>
  <p>Implement cost awareness into your organizational processes to ensure that cost implications are considered in decision-making. This includes integrating cost considerations into architecture reviews, project planning, procurement processes, and operational procedures. Cost awareness should be embedded throughout the organization, not just within finance teams.</p>
</div>

## Implementation guidance

Cost awareness means making cost implications visible and actionable at the time decisions are made, rather than discovering costs after they've been incurred. This requires integrating cost considerations into existing organizational processes and creating new processes where needed.

### Key steps for implementing this best practice:

1. **Integrate cost into architecture and design processes**:
   - Include cost analysis in architecture review boards
   - Implement cost modeling for new projects and features
   - Create cost-aware design patterns and guidelines
   - Establish cost thresholds for architectural decisions

2. **Embed cost considerations in project management**:
   - Include cloud costs in project business cases and ROI calculations
   - Implement cost tracking and reporting for projects
   - Establish cost approval workflows for project resources
   - Create cost-aware project planning templates and tools

3. **Implement cost-aware development practices**:
   - Provide cost visibility in development and testing environments
   - Implement cost budgets for development teams
   - Create cost optimization guidelines for developers
   - Establish cost review processes for code deployments

4. **Integrate cost into operational processes**:
   - Include cost metrics in operational dashboards and reports
   - Implement cost-aware incident response procedures
   - Create cost optimization runbooks and procedures
   - Establish cost review processes for operational changes

5. **Implement cost-aware procurement and vendor management**:
   - Include total cost of ownership in vendor evaluations
   - Implement cost optimization requirements in contracts
   - Create cost-aware service selection criteria
   - Establish regular cost reviews with vendors

6. **Create cost awareness training and enablement**:
   - Develop cost optimization training programs for different roles
   - Create cost awareness materials and resources
   - Implement cost optimization certification programs
   - Establish cost optimization communities of practice

## Process integration strategies

### Architecture Review Integration

**Cost-Aware Architecture Reviews**:
- **Cost Impact Assessment**: Evaluate the cost implications of architectural decisions
- **Alternative Analysis**: Compare costs of different architectural approaches
- **Optimization Opportunities**: Identify potential cost optimization opportunities
