  <h1>COST02-BP01: Develop policies based on your organization requirements</h1>
  <p>Develop policies that define how your organization will use cloud resources. These policies should be based on your organization's requirements, including compliance, security, and cost management needs. Policies provide the foundation for all other governance activities and should be clearly documented, communicated, and regularly updated.</p>
</div>

## Implementation guidance

Effective cloud governance starts with well-defined policies that reflect your organization's unique requirements, constraints, and objectives. These policies serve as the foundation for all governance activities and provide clear guidance for teams on acceptable cloud usage patterns.

### Policy Development Framework

**Requirements Analysis**: Begin by thoroughly understanding your organization's requirements across multiple dimensions including compliance obligations, security requirements, budget constraints, operational needs, and business objectives.

**Stakeholder Engagement**: Involve key stakeholders from finance, security, compliance, operations, and business units to ensure policies address all organizational needs and have broad support.

**Policy Hierarchy**: Establish a clear hierarchy of policies from high-level organizational principles down to specific technical implementation guidelines, ensuring consistency and avoiding conflicts.

**Risk-Based Approach**: Develop policies that are proportionate to risk levels, with more stringent controls for high-risk activities and more flexibility for low-risk scenarios.

### Core Policy Areas

**Resource Usage Policies**: Define acceptable resource types, sizes, and configurations based on workload requirements and cost considerations. Include guidelines for right-sizing, instance families, and storage classes.

**Access and Permissions**: Establish policies for who can provision resources, what permissions are required, and how access should be managed across different environments and teams.

**Cost Management**: Define spending limits, approval thresholds, budget allocation methods, and cost allocation requirements. Include policies for handling budget overruns and cost optimization activities.

**Compliance and Security**: Ensure policies address regulatory requirements, data protection needs, and security standards that apply to your organization and industry.

### Policy Implementation Strategy

**Phased Rollout**: Implement policies gradually, starting with the most critical areas and expanding over time. This allows for learning and adjustment without disrupting operations.

**Automation Integration**: Design policies that can be enforced through automated controls where possible, reducing manual oversight burden and ensuring consistent application.

**Exception Handling**: Establish clear processes for handling exceptions to policies, including approval workflows, documentation requirements, and time-limited exemptions.

**Communication and Training**: Ensure policies are clearly communicated to all relevant teams and provide training on policy requirements and implementation procedures.

## AWS Services to Consider
