## Key Concepts

### Resource Decommissioning Principles

**Lifecycle Management**: Implement comprehensive tracking of resources from creation to decommissioning, ensuring no resources are forgotten or left running unnecessarily.

**Systematic Process**: Establish standardized procedures for identifying, evaluating, and decommissioning resources to ensure consistent and thorough cleanup.

**Data Protection**: Ensure that data retention requirements are met and sensitive data is properly handled during the decommissioning process.

**Automation**: Use automated tools and processes to identify unused resources and perform routine decommissioning tasks to reduce manual effort and human error.

### Decommissioning Framework Components

**Resource Discovery**: Systematic identification of all resources across accounts, regions, and services to ensure comprehensive coverage.

**Usage Analysis**: Evaluation of resource utilization patterns to identify candidates for decommissioning based on actual usage data.

**Impact Assessment**: Analysis of dependencies and business impact before decommissioning resources to prevent service disruptions.

**Execution Process**: Structured approach to safely decommissioning resources while preserving necessary data and maintaining service continuity.

### Types of Resource Decommissioning

**End-of-Life Decommissioning**: Systematic shutdown of resources when projects end, applications are retired, or business requirements change.

**Optimization Decommissioning**: Removal of underutilized or redundant resources identified through cost optimization activities.

**Compliance Decommissioning**: Decommissioning driven by regulatory requirements, security policies, or data retention mandates.

**Emergency Decommissioning**: Rapid resource shutdown in response to security incidents, cost overruns, or other urgent situations.
