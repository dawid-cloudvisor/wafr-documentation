# Navigation Structure

This page provides an overview of the documentation structure for the AWS Well-Architected Framework.

## Pillars

The AWS Well-Architected Framework is organized into six pillars:

1. [Operational Excellence](/docs/operational-excellence/) - The ability to run and monitor systems to deliver business value and to continually improve supporting processes and procedures.

2. [Security](/docs/security/) - The ability to protect information, systems, and assets while delivering business value through risk assessments and mitigation strategies.

3. [Reliability](/docs/reliability/) - The ability of a system to recover from infrastructure or service disruptions, dynamically acquire computing resources to meet demand, and mitigate disruptions such as misconfigurations or transient network issues.

4. [Performance Efficiency](/docs/performance-efficiency/) - The ability to use computing resources efficiently to meet system requirements, and to maintain that efficiency as demand changes and technologies evolve.

5. [Cost Optimization](/docs/cost-optimization/) - The ability to run systems to deliver business value at the lowest price point.

6. [Sustainability](/docs/sustainability/) - The ability to continually improve sustainability impacts by reducing energy consumption and increasing efficiency across all components of a workload by maximizing the benefits from the provisioned resources and minimizing the total resources required.

## Questions

Each pillar contains a set of questions that can be used to evaluate your architecture against the best practices defined in the AWS Well-Architected Framework. The questions are organized by topic area within each pillar.

## How to Use This Documentation

1. Start by reviewing the overview of each pillar to understand its key concepts and principles.
2. Explore the specific questions within each pillar to assess your architecture.
3. Use the implementation guidance provided for each question to improve your architecture.
4. Refer to the recommended AWS services and resources for additional information.
